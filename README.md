This project is a Decentralized News Service that uses Blockchain technology to provide a secure and transparent platform for news publishers and consumers. The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to manage the news publishing process. The platform allows publishers to submit news articles to the blockchain, where they are stored in a secure and tamper-proof manner. Consumers can then access the news articles through a web interface, where they can view the articles and verify their authenticity. The platform also includes a reputation system that allows consumers to rate the quality of news articles and publishers. This helps to ensure that only high-quality news articles are published on the platform. The project is currently an example of one of many use cases of the Chainlink Functions service. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please check out our GitHub repository and get in touch with me. I would love to have a chat! # Path: strong-saturn/README.md
